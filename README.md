# Network Analysis of GoT

This is a project from Datacamp.

In this project,the goal is to examine the character co-occurrence network and its evolution over the five books in R.R. Martin's hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire (perhaps better known as the TV show Game of Thrones). 
How the importance of the characters changes over the books is conveyed using different centrality measures.
networkx library and pandas are used in this case study.
